🏠 Nairobi House Price Prediction

This is a machine learning project that predicts residential property prices in Nairobi using structured property features and location-based signals.

This project includes:

1. Data cleaning and feature engineering

2. Model training and evaluation (Linear Regression & Random Forest)

3. A Streamlit web app for local price prediction


📌 Business Problem

Real estate pricing in Nairobi varies significantly by:

- Location

- Property type

- House size

- Bedrooms and bathrooms

- Land size


This project aims to:

Build a data-driven model that predicts property prices and provides a reasonable price range using historical data.

🎯 Objectives

1. Identify key features influencing house prices in Nairobi

2. Build a predictive model with strong performance

3. Create an interactive local web application


🗂 Dataset Features

The dataset includes:

Price

Location

Bedroom

bathroom

House size (m²)

Land size (m²)

Property type indicators



🤖 Models Used
1️⃣ Linear Regression

Used as a baseline model.

Performance:

R² ≈ 0.47

MAE ≈ 53M KSh

RMSE ≈ 119M KSh

2️⃣ Random Forest Regressor

Final selected model.

Performance:

R² ≈ 0.70

MAE ≈ 40M KSh

RMSE ≈ 90M KSh

Random Forest significantly improved predictive accuracy by capturing non-linear relationships and location effects.
